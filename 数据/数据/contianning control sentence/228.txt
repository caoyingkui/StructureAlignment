As an example, we iterate over every book document in the index and find books like each one.
Here we look up books that are like this one.
Books by the same author are considered alike and are boosted so they will likely appear before books by other authors.
Using the terms from the  subject term vectors, we add each to a boolean query.
We combine the author and subject queries into a final boolean query.
We exclude the current book, which would surely be the best match given the other criteria, from consideration.
