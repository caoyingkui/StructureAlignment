Synonym buffer
The code successively pops the stack of buffered synonyms from the last streamed-in token until itâ€™s empty
After all previous token synonyms have been emitted, we read the next token
We push all synonyms of the current token onto the stack
Now we return the current (and original) token before its associated synonyms
Synonyms are retrieved from the  SynonymEngine 
We push each synonym onto the stack
The position increment is set to zero, allowing synonyms to be logically in the same place as the original term
