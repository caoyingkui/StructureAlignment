IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter("MyIndexFolder", new StandardAnalyzer());
var doc = new Document();
var idField = new Field("id", "MyItemId", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED);
doc.Add(idField);
writer.AddDocument(doc);
writer.Commit();
Term idTerm = new Term("id", "MyItemId");
writer.DeleteDocuments(idTerm);
writer.Commit();

It's not necessary to open an IndexReader if you're already using an IndexWriter or to access IndexSearcher.Reader. 
You can use IndexWriter.DeleteDocuments(Term), but the tricky part is making sure you've stored your id field correctly in the first place. 
Be sure and use Field.Index.NOTANALYZED as the index setting on your id field when storing the document. 
This indexes the field without tokenizing it, which is very important, and none of the other Field.Index values will work when used this way
Now you can easily delete or update the document using the same writer
