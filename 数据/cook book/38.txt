List<Document> documents = new ArraList<Document>();
Query query = parser.parse(searchTerm);
TopDocs hits = searcher.search(query, maxNumberOfResults);
int end = Math.min(hits.totalHits, size);

return documents;

When we perform search in Lucene, actual results are not preloaded immediately. 
In TopDocs,we only get back an array of ranked pointers. 
It's called ranked pointers because they are not actual documents, but a list of references (DocId). 
By default, results are scored by the scoring mechanism. 
We will see more about scoring in detail in Introduction section Chapter 7, Flexible Scoring. 
For paging, we can calculate position offset, apply pagination ourselves, and leverage something like what we showed in the sample code to return results by page. 
Developers at Lucene actually recommend re-executing a search on every page, instead of storing the initial search results . 
The reasoning is that people are usually only interested in top results and they are confident in Lucene's performance.
