Directory directory = getDirectory();
IndexReader indexReader = DirectoryReader.open(directory);
IndexSearcher indexSearcher = new IndexSearcher(indexReader);

The first line assumes we can gain access to a Directory object by calling  getDirectory() .
Then, we obtain an  IndexReader by calling  DirectoryReader.open(directory) . 
The open method in  DirectoryReader is a static method that opens an index to read, which is analogous to  IndexWriter opening a directory to write. 
With an IndexReader initialized, we can instantiate an  IndexSearcher with the reader.
