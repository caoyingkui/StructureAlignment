QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("Content", analyzer);
Query query = parser.parse("Lucene");

Assuming an analyzer is already declared and available as a variable, we pass it into QueryParser to initialize the parser. 
The second parameter is the name of the field where we will perform a search. 
In this case, we are searching a field called Content. 
Then, we call parse(String) to interpret the search string Lucene into Query object. 
Note that, at this point, we only return a Query object. 
We have not actually executed a search yet.
