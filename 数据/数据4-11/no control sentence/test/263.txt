This is the  ISBN number for Rudolf Steiner’s A Modern Art of Education.
We construct a query for education books on special, which only includes Steiner’s book in this example.
We construct a query for all books with logo in the subject, which only includes Mindstorms in our sample data.
The two queries are combined in an OR fashion.
