Document document = new Document();
document.add(new StringField("telephone_number", "04735264927", Field.Store.YES));
document.add(new StringField("area_code", "0484",Field.Store.YES));
indexWriter.addDocument(document);
indexWriter.commit();

In this example, we created a  StringField named telephone number to store the telephone number of a user.
The  04735264927 value will be indexed as a single token. 
So, a query seeking an exact match of the telephone number will work fine in this case. 
Also, note the Field.Store.Yes option. We can control whether the field value should be stored or not.
If you do not want to store the field you can use  Field.Store.No . 
You can still sort by this field, but this value may not be included in the search results in this case.
The creation of a StringField is straightforward. 
We just need to specify the field type as StringField at the time of adding documents to the index. 
The options to store the field or not is also applicable in the case of a StringField.
