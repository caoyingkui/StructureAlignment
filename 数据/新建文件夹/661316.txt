StringReader testReader = new StringReader("C.F.A. C.F.A word");
StandardAnalyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
TokenStream tokenStream = analyzer.tokenStream("title", testReader);
System.out.println(tokenStream.next());
System.out.println(tokenStream.next());
System.out.println(tokenStream.next());

The StandardAnalyzer specifically handles acronyms, and converts C.F.A. (for example) to cfa.
This means you should be able to do the search, as long as you make sure you use the same analyzer for the indexing and for the query parsing.
