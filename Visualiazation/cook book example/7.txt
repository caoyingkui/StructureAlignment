GOAL:
Obtaining a TokenStream

DESCRIPTION:
TokenStream is an intermediate data format between components within the analysis
process. TokenStream acts as both an input and output format in all filters. For tokenizer,
it consumes text from a reader and outputs result as TokenStream. Let's explore TokenStream
in detail in this section.

CODE:
Reader reader = new StringReader("Text to be passed");
Analyzer analyzer = new SimpleAnalyzer();
TokenStream tokenStream = analyzer.tokenStream("myField", reader);

COMMENT:
An analyzer processes incoming text via a Reader input. 
Internally, the Reader is passed on to Tokenizer, which turns the text into a TokenStream after it's been processed. 
From here on, TokenStream is passed around between filters in every step. 
TokenStream is essentially an enumeration of tokens that you can iterate through. 
TokenStream extends from AttributeSource and it provides an interface to return token attributes and value.
