GOAL:
Creating a TextField

DESCRIPTION:
Don't be confused between a StringField and TextField. 
Although both the fields contain textual data, there are major differences between these two fields. 
A StringField is not tokenized and it's a good tool for exact match and sorting. 
A TextField is tokenized and it's useful for storing any unstructured text for indexing. 
When you pass the text into an Analyzer for indexing, a TextField is what's used to store the text content.

CODE:
Document document = new Document();
String text = "Lucene is an Information Retrieval library written in Java.";
doc.add(new TextField("text", text, Field.Store.YES));
indexWriter.addDocument(document);
indexWriter.commit();

COMMENT:
This is a very simple example showing how a TextField is added, assuming that you have an Analyzer already created for the IndexWriter on the  text field. 
The analysis process will run against this field to index the content within.
