GOAL:
Obtaining an IndexSearcher

DESCRIPTION:
The IndexSearcher class is the gateway to search an index as far as Lucene is concerned.
An IndexSearcher takes an  IndexReader object and performs a search via the reader.
IndexReader talks to the index physically and returns the results.  IndexSearcher
executes a search by accepting a query object. Next, we will learn how to perform a search
and create a Query object with a  QueryParser . For now, let's take a look at how we can
obtain an IndexSearcher.

CODE:
Directory directory = getDirectory();
IndexReader indexReader = DirectoryReader.open(directory);
IndexSearcher indexSearcher = new IndexSearcher(indexReader);

COMMENT:
The first line assumes we can gain access to a Directory object by calling  getDirectory() .
Then, we obtain an  IndexReader by calling  DirectoryReader.open(directory) . 
The open method in  DirectoryReader is a static method that opens an index to read, which is analogous to  IndexWriter opening a directory to write. 
With an  IndexReader initialized, we can instantiate an  IndexSearcher with the reader.
