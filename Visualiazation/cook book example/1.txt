GOAL:
Obtaining an IndexWriter

DESCRIPTION:
The IndexWriter class provides functionality to create and manage index. The class can
be found in Lucene-core. It handles basic operations where you can add, delete, and update
documents. It also handles more complex use cases that we will cover during the course of
this book.

CODE:
Analyzer analyzer = new WhitespaceAnalyzer();
Directory directory = new RAMDirectory();
IndexWriterConfig config = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LATEST, analyzer);
IndexWriter indexWriter = new IndexWriter(directory, config);

COMMENT:
First, we instantiate a  WhitespaceAnalyzer to parse input text, and tokenize text into word tokens. 
Then, we create an in-memory Directory by instantiating  RAMDirectory . 
We configure  IndexWriterConfig with the  WhitespaceAnalyzer we just created.
finally, we pass both Directory and  IndexWriterConfig to create an IndexWriter.
The IndexWriter is now ready to update the index.
