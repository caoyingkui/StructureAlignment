GOAL:
Creating and writing documents to an index

DESCRIPTION:
This recipe shows you how to index a document. In fact, here we are putting together all that
we learned so far from the previous recipes. Let's see how it is done.

CODE:
Analyzer analyzer = new WhitespaceAnalyzer();
Directory directory = new RAMDirectory();
IndexWriterConfig config = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LATEST, analyzer);
IndexWriter indexWriter = new IndexWriter(directory, config);
Document doc = new Document();
String text = "Lucene is an Information Retrieval library written in Java";
doc.add(new TextField("fieldname", text, Field.Store.YES));
indexWriter.addDocument(doc);
indexWriter.close();

COMMENT:
Note that the preceding code snippet combined all the sample codes we learned so far.
It first initializes an analyzer, directory,  IndexWriterConfig , and  IndexWriter . 
Once the IndexWriter is obtained, a new Document is created with a custom  TextField . 
The Document is then added to IndexWriter. 
Also, note that we call  indexWriter.close() at the end. 
calling this method, will commit all changes and close the index.
