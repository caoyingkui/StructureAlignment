GOAL:
Creating queries with the Lucene QueryParser


DESCRIPTION:
Internally, Lucene processes Query objects to execute a search. QueryParser is an interpreter
that parses a query string into Query objects. It provides the utility to convert textual input
into objects. The key method in QueryParser is parse (String). If you want more control over
how a search is performed, you can create Query objects directly without using QueryParser,
but this would be a much more complicated process. The query string syntax Lucene uses
has a few rules

CODE:
QueryParser parser = new QueryParser("Content", analyzer);
Query query = parser.parse("Lucene");

COMMENT:
Assuming an analyzer is already declared and available as a variable, we pass it into QueryParser to initialize the parser. 
The second parameter is the name of the field where we will perform a search. 
In this case, we are searching a field called Content. 
Then, we call parse(String) to interpret the search string Lucene into Query object. 
Note that, at this point, we only return a Query object. We have not actually executed a search yet.
